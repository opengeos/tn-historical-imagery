## TN-historical-imagery

A Interactive Web App for Visualizing Tennessee Historical Imagery

### Introduction

This web app allows users to visualize historical imagery for Tennessee. The historical imagery is provided by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) and includes aerial 2-ft resolution photos taken between 1997 and 2006.
The original imagery in MrSID format was download from the [TNGIC Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qYlPFBLkcOpO4xjvBvHwMH9RDtbsSNkv). The imagery was then converted to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF format
and hosted on Source Cooperative.
